# Text-Summarizer
Introduction

In today's digital age, information overload has become a significant challenge. With the vast amount of text available online, it can be overwhelming for individuals to extract relevant information efficiently. Text summarization, a subfield of natural language processing (NLP), offers a promising solution to this problem. By condensing lengthy texts into concise summaries while retaining key information, text summarization systems enable users to quickly grasp the main points of a document without having to read through the entire content.

About this Project

This work focuses on using the t5 model to text summarization, expanding on prior research efforts. The goal of our paper is to construct a summary of YouTube comments by utilizing the Validation Accuracy within the T5 model to obtain more accuracy.The T5 model is a Natural Language Processing technique that has the ability to simplify complex narratives into logical and consumable summaries
